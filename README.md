ABR_TEST_IOIO
=============

Simple Android App used to test your IOIO.

Use this app to control a servo or motor (PWM output) with a slider, read and display values from an analog sensor 
(e.g. IR), and switch on/off the LED (digital output). 

Good example to see how you can create a separate class file for the IOIO thread.
